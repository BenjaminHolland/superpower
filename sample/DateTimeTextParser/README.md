# Superpower sample / `DateTimeTextParser`

This example shows how to build a simple text parser with Superpower.
It uses a simple and well known requirement: parsing date and time values 
according to ISO-8601 format. (Time zones and fractional seconds are not
covered by the example.

For example:

 - `2017-01-01`
 - `2017-01-01 12:10`
 - `2017-01-01 12:10:30`
